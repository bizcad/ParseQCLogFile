# ParseQCLogFile
Parses into csv a QuantConnect log.txt which is output automatically by the Open Source version of the <a href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean>QuantConnect Lean Engine</a>.


Usage: 
	ParseLogFile {filepath}
	
The filepath for this version is hardcoded.  So clone the project and change the path in Program.Main to a file of your preference.

Otherwise you can supply the full file path, including the file name, on the command line.

# Output
The program will output a .csv file with the Start Date and End Date of the algorithm's back test.  The other columns are the lines in the file with the string STATISTICS:: in a line.  

So you end up with a file you can open in Excel and see how different runs compare.  Lean does not overwrite the log.txt between runs.  It can get quite long and I got tired of running through the file looking for CAR and the like.

I add the following method to my algorithm to give me some extra information in the log file, and this program picks these up and gives me a column in the csv file.  This way I can run different algorithms and see how they compare.

<code>
        public override void OnEndOfAlgorithm()
        {
            Debug(string.Format("\nAlgorithm Name: {0}\n Symbol: {1}\n Ending Portfolio Value: {2} \n",
			this.GetType().Name,
			symbol,
			Portfolio.TotalPortfolioValue));
        }
</code>

This current version is intended to track only one symbol. If you are using multiple symbols you will need to change the string written in the above method to supply a list of symbol names you use in your algorithm.
